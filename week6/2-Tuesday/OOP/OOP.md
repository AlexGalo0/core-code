# OOP Glosary 

## Concepts


1. *Abstraction*: It consists in just selecting the important details about something, and only show those details, in order to avoid adding unnecesary complexity.
2. *Inheritance*: Is using previously defined classes as a base to create another class that shares all of the atributes and methods that the _parent_ class has.
    We define a class as a parent when that class is extended in another one.
3. *Polymorphism*:  Is the diferent behavior that some object may have with the same methods calls.
4. *Encapsulation*: Is to hide the atributes and methods of a class. 
5. *Class*: Is some form of "blueprint" that help us to instanciate objects.
6. *Object*: Is the instance of a class, that help us represent objects of real life.
7. *Instance* : Is a case or ocurrence of anything, if we create a object School named School1, School1 is an ocurrence of School, an instance.
8. *Interface*: Is a form that help us generalize attributes and methods in classes that implements the interface, like a "contract".
9. *Access modifiers* : Keywords that help us  change the access to properties of classes . 
10. *Constructor* : Is the method that is called when we create an object, that help us specify how we do it.

## Example  
In this section , we will see how to use all of this concepts applied in *Typescript.*

### Â¿How to create a *class* in Typescript*?
    ```typescript```
