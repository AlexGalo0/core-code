# core-code.

## Tuesday 1/11/22 Assignments.

1) Watch the compiled or interpreted video.
	Done.
2) Is Java compiled or interpreted?
	Both, is interpreted at first and the output of that interpretation is compiled.
3) Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD.
	1. Find out the conversion rate of my local currency to USD. (In my case, it would be 1$ == 25 Lps.)
	2. Multiply how much do i have of my currency with the conversion rate.
4) Read about pseudocode.
	Done.
5) Why is pseudocode helpful?
	It helps us to have an basic idea of how do we want to solve our problem with code without having to worry about syntax of the specific language.
	
6) Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born.
	1. bornYear<--
	2. currentYear=2022
	3. age=currentYear-bornYear.

7) Read about flowcharts.
	Done.

8) Why are flowcharts so helpful to developers?
	It help us to see the "big picture" of our algorithm,  to be able to recognize the diferent paths our algorithm can take.
	
9) Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages.
